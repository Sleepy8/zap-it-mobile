# Setup Notification Sounds for Beautiful ZAP Notifications

## Overview
The new notification system includes beautiful, distinctive sounds for ZAP notifications. You need to add the sound files to make the notifications complete.

## Required Sound Files

### Android (zap_sound.mp3)
**Location**: `android/app/src/main/res/raw/zap_sound.mp3`

**Requirements**:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Quality: High (128kbps or higher)
- Characteristic: Short, distinctive, energetic sound
- Recommended: A quick "zap" or "electric" sound effect

**How to create**:
1. Download a free sound effect from sites like:
   - Freesound.org
   - Zapsplat.com
   - Soundbible.com
2. Look for keywords: "zap", "electric", "spark", "lightning"
3. Convert to MP3 if needed
4. Trim to 1-2 seconds
5. Place in the raw folder

### iOS (zap_sound.aiff)
**Location**: `ios/Runner/zap_sound.aiff`

**Requirements**:
- Format: AIFF
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Quality: High
- Characteristic: Same as Android version

**How to create**:
1. Use the same sound as Android
2. Convert to AIFF format using:
   - Online converters
   - Audacity (free audio editor)
   - FFmpeg command: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.aiff`

## Alternative: Use System Sounds

If you prefer to use system sounds instead of custom files, you can modify the notification service:

### Android System Sounds
Replace the sound line in `notification_service.dart`:
```dart
// Instead of:
sound: RawResourceAndroidNotificationSound('zap_sound'),

// Use:
sound: AndroidNotificationSound('notification_sound'),
```

### iOS System Sounds
Replace the sound line:
```dart
// Instead of:
sound: 'zap_sound.aiff',

// Use:
sound: 'default',
```

## Testing the Sounds

1. Run the app
2. Go to Profile screen
3. Tap "Test Sistema ZAP"
4. Tap "Test Notifica Bellissima"
5. You should hear the custom sound

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound on Android
- Check if the file is in the correct location
- Verify the file name matches exactly
- Ensure the file is a valid MP3
- Check device volume settings

### No Sound on iOS
- Check if the file is in the correct location
- Verify the file name matches exactly
- Ensure the file is a valid AIFF
- Check device volume settings

### Sound Too Loud/Quiet
- Adjust the volume in the sound file
- Use audio editing software to normalize the volume
- Test on different devices

## Recommended Sound Characteristics

For the best ZAP experience, the sound should be:
- **Short**: 1-2 seconds maximum
- **Distinctive**: Immediately recognizable as a ZAP
- **Energetic**: Conveys the feeling of energy/lightning
- **Clear**: Works well on all device speakers
