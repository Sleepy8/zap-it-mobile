# Notification System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Duplicate Notifications Removed
**Problem**: Two background message handlers were causing duplicate notifications
- `notification_service.dart` had one handler
- `background_service.dart` had another handler

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate handler from `background_service.dart`
- Unified all notification handling in `notification_service.dart`
- Single, clean background message handler

### 2. âœ… Notifications Only Show When Receiving (Not Sending)
**Problem**: Notifications were appearing when sending ZAPs instead of receiving them

**Solution**:
- Modified `sendZapNotification()` to NOT show local notifications when sending
- Notifications now only appear when receiving ZAPs via Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Clean separation between sending and receiving logic

### 3. âœ… Beautiful Notification Design Implemented
**Problem**: Basic, ugly notifications

**Solution**: 
- Added `flutter_local_notifications` dependency
- Created beautiful notification design with:
  - Custom colors (lime green for ZAP)
  - Large icons and rich text
  - Distinctive vibration patterns
  - Custom sounds (when added)
  - Professional styling

## New Features Added

### ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful Notification Design
```dart
// ZAP notifications with:
- Lime green color theme
- Lightning bolt emoji (âš¡)
- Rich text formatting
- Large app icon
- Custom vibration pattern
- Distinctive sound (when configured)
```

### ðŸ“³ Enhanced Vibration Pattern
```dart
// New beautiful ZAP vibration:
pattern: [0, 100, 50, 150, 50, 200, 50, 150, 50, 100]
intensities: [0, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255]
// Creates a distinctive "zap" feeling
```
