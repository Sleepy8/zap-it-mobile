# Codemagic CI/CD Configuration
# 
# iOS Workflows:
# - ios-development: For testing IPA builds without code signing (use this first)
# - ios-device-build: For device IPA builds with code signing (requires Apple Developer Account)
# - ios-workflow: For simulator builds (no code signing required)
# 
# Note: For device builds and App Store deployment, you'll need:
# 1. Apple Developer Account ($99/year or free with limitations)
# 2. Code signing certificates
# 3. Provisioning profiles
# 4. App Store Connect API credentials
# 
# To use ios-device-build workflow:
# 1. Replace YOUR_TEAM_ID with your Apple Developer Team ID
# 2. Replace YOUR_PROVISIONING_PROFILE with your provisioning profile name
# 3. Replace YOUR_CERTIFICATE with your certificate name
# 4. Replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your certificate password
# 5. Configure these in Codemagic Team Settings > Code signing identities
# 
# Android Workflows:
# - android-workflow: For Android APK and App Bundle builds
# 
# Web Workflows:
# - web-workflow: For web builds
