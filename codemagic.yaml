# Codemagic CI/CD Configuration
# 
# iOS Workflows:
# - ios-development: For testing builds without code signing (use this first)
# - ios-workflow: For release builds (requires proper code signing setup)
# 
# Android Workflows:
# - android-workflow: For Android APK and App Bundle builds
# 
# Web Workflows:
# - web-workflow: For web builds
